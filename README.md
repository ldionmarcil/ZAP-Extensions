ZAP Extensions
==============

This is a small subset of the ZAP extensions I have created over time to help automate most of my webapp auditing process.

- wpscan
 - wpscan.java is a wrapper for the wpscan tool. It is configured to wrap around /usr/bin/wpscan, so it is not Windows friendly (yet?).
